smartLock

SmartLock consist of a set of C++ classes which help to
synchronize a block of code. Due to scope within C++ and
the way destructors are called SmartLock-classes reduce the
locking/unlocking overhead

USAGE:
see examples.cc

SmartLock:
SmartLock takes an initialized pthread_mutex_t as parameter
and acquires the given lock. It will throw an exception if
an internal error occured or the mutex is not initialized.
It will unlock the mutex as soon as the destructor is called.


SmartRDLock / SmartWRLock:
Operates on pthread_rwlock_t instead of pthread_mutex_t.
SmartRDLock locks for reading and SmartWRLock for writing.
